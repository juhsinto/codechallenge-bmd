# Code Challenge for BMD

This project was created using create-react-app

## Libraries used
- reduxjs/toolkit - for state management
- axios - for API calls
- bootstrap - but only for the spinner :P

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

This will launch the cypress tests

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.


## More
- I used typescript for this project to make it more typesafe & robust, and the reader knows what to expect when accessing objects.
- I split the code into Services/Store/Components - this is good practice for maintainability & scaling it in future.
